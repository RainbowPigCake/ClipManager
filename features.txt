use a framework to build good user interface with good performance (preferably not python, too many projects in python, OOP)

classes
Clip (singular clip with video, length, size, name, date)
Grid (many videos in a grid, has many clips)
ClipFolderManager (main class that brings everything together)

choose folder path for clip directory (type in path or choose folder location with windows explorer)
view videos in a grid (each clip is a rectangle with a thumbnail, shows name date length size)
adjust the width of the grid (number of videos per row)
preview video when clicked on (video player with options)
when previewing a video, the video is highlighted on the grid
move left and right between clips from the grid while previewing
accept most common video formats (.mp4, .DVR,... more)
trim videos (choose a new start and end point of a clip)
include only chosen subsections of video (more advanced trim)
stretch back to native/target resolution (example playing csgo stretched 1280 960 -> 1920 1080)
rename videos (refresh directory after this)
delete clips (should delete locally and in the folder, don't need to refresh)
favourite clips (useful for showing important clips)
show favourite clips (this will show an extra grid on top with only the favourite clips, will not affect the primary grid)
search clip by name (contains query)
search clip by date (during, before inclusive, after inclusive)
sort clips by size (useful for seeing which clips take up the most space)
sort clips by name (not the most useful unless the file naming convention includes a name)
sort clips by date (see most recent, very useful)
after clicking on a video to preview, the scroll position is kept on exit (quality of life consideration)
colour themes (need good framework that makes this easy to do with palettes)
add clips to group/tag/label (organization feature)
organize into groups button (many grids of clips, might not implement this)

need to think of when to refresh the clip viewer grid (annoying when you need to click a refresh button often)
